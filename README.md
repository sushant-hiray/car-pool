Car pooling at your doorstep.





Compiling Instructions:
======================
To build the application on your local server make sure you have apache installed and your mysql server is up and running.

* Take the `car-pool/` directory in your webapps folder.
* Make sure the permissions are set. Use `chmod -R 775 car-pool`
* Access `http://localhost:80/car-pool/initialise.php`. This will make sure the database is initialised.
This is to be done only once! :)
* To start playing with car-pool access `http://localhost:80/car-pool/index.php`

It will redirect you to a login page from where you can register.
Once you have successfully registered, login again and explore the world of car-pool.

What is carpooling?
==================
For those who are still wondering what is the hype with carpooling, well for a first it is definitely not car pulling! :(
As wikipedia states it: Carpooling is the sharing of car journeys so that more than one person travels in a car.
